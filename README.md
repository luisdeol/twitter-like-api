# TwitterLike ASP.NET Core application
A Twitter-like ASP.NET Core back-end application. It is designed and implemented based on Clean Architecture and CQRS concepts. 

I decided to develop this application because I wanted to keep improving my architecture design and software practices, and to make that application a reference for the .NET community;

## Running the application
